oss calculates whether certain numbers are prime or not.
	Options:
	(-h): Display help message and exit
	(-n x): Indicate the maximum total child processes oss will ever create. (Default 4)
	(-s x): Indicate the number of children allowed to exist in the system at the same time. (Default 2)
	(-b x): Start of the sequence of numbers to be tested for primality. (Default 100)
	(-i x): Increment between numbers that we test. (Default 3)
	(-o filename): Output file for logging. (Default output.txt)

	All options are converted to their absolute values. The absolute value of a negative prime number is also prime anyways.

	changeLog.txt has the git log of changes made to the program over time.
	
	Enter 'make' to have the Makefile compile all the necessary files. Enter 'make clean' to clean up object files and the executables.

	Problems encountered:
		-Took a while to figure out a good way to implement the clock
		-Didn't run in to too many issues where I got stuck without direction. Some parts took a while but looking up documenation I had a clear path on what I needed to do.
